      "You're given a row of 10 blocks, each with a number printed on the block.  The numbers are arbitrary, but you can imagine that they are generated randomly at the start of problem.  Unfortunately you're mostly blind, so you can only read the numbers of the blocks you are holding.  Since you have two hands, we'll assume you can hold, at most, one block in each hand for a total of two blocks at a time.  Imagine you're getting old, so your brain is not what it used to be -- let's assume you can only remember one number at a time.  This last bit of information may be useful, but is not entirely necessary to come up with a solution.  The end goal of this scenario is to identify (i.e. report) the minimum number that was observed on the blocks. "

In other words, there always needs to be an even number of blocks in the row you're picking from, so with 10 blocks after one recursive step there are 5 blocks left, which won't work.  That's fine though, since 10 is a somewhat arbitrary number anyhow -- we'll look at coding both of these solutions."

The first way involves making an interactive notebook (which is how I'm generating this document) so you can experiment with Python commands and whatnot, and the other is to run Canopy.  Notebooks are run and edited through the web browser (I'm using Firefox, which is working okay).  To open up the notebook dashboard open Windows Command Prompt and type:"

Notice that any output from the statements will be appended to the cell -- in this case, Python printed the number 42.  IPython notebooks support HTML in the form of 'markdown cells', so you can document your thoughts in the same view with the code, which is really helpful for learning.  For more information about using the notebook check here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/ipython/ipython/raw/master/examples/notebooks/Part%25201%2520-%2520Running%2520Code.ipynb.  If you're not comfortable with the notebook interface, the other option is to use Canopy.  Upon launching Canopy, simply open up the Editor and create a new file.  Say I want to create a python file that does the same thing as the notebook example I just gave above.  Simply type in the Python statements into the blank file (the top tile) and save.  Remember to include the file extension '.py' when you save the file.  The bottom window of the Canopy Editor is the <i>shell</i>, which functions much like a code cell in the notebook.  To run your code, simply type the following (replacing <i>file</i> with whatever you named the file):"
