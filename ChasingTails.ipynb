      "So Clicks can be [played out using a thread](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/avonmoll/thneed-factory/master/metplayback_nonblocking.ipynb \"NonBlocking Met Playback\") (via the `Met` class) and [raw audio can be read in and manipulated](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/avonmoll/thneed-factory/master/BeatDetection.ipynb \"Detecting Beats\").  Now the trick is to get this to happen simultaneously.  To make it an even bigger challenge it would be nice to update a plot in real time showing the occurrance of beats versus the metronome clicks.  This is getting at the heart of what [this project]( \"main page not created yet\") is intending to accomplish.  First, however, the following questions must be answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Is the thread implementation for `Met` viable for producing sounds on a regular interval?\n",
      "2. Would a thread implementation be appropriate for some kind of `Listener` class that can read in and manipulate the raw audio in the background?\n",
      "\n",
      "A (possible/naive) concern with going this route of thread-based execution is a breakdown of simultaneity between the two threads.  In order to verify the viability of this method the human aspect will be taken out of the loop"
